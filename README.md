# Disclaimer

This repo is Fork from rygo6 and it's been amended due to show some tips and tricks with cards.

-------

This is a basic example demonstrating how to create the basis of a system to deal with a card game in Unity.

Video of app running can be seen here:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrHJLHcWjSA

Currently the app demonstrates these things:
- Drops a deck of cards onto table instantiated from an AssetBundle.
- Allows you to shuffle the deck of cards.
- Allows you to draw a card.
- Allows you to see the last 5 drawn cards.
- All used cards are restacked.
- Cards can be reshuffled and reset at any time.

Technical
- App is built in Unity 5.6.2f1
- Currently tested to be building for OSX, Linux and Windows platforms
- Currently hasn't been tested for running properly on Linux.
